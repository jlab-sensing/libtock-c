ENTS Protobuf Example
=========

App includes the necessary source files and demonstrates how to encode a repeated sensor measurement command with TEROS12 data.

Files are copied from [ents-firmware repo](https://github.com/jlab-sensing/ENTS-node-firmware/tree/c5c7d364068dc00ec7cdce562b29ab6a69ed8ca6/proto/c). This repo has additional documentation on implementation and usage. In the future we will setup a library that automatically gets upstream updates.
